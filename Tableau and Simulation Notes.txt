# Simulation

### Lecture 01 - Introduction to Simulation

- Simulation: Imitate the operations of a facility or process, usually via computer
  - Facility or process of interest that is to be simulated is the system
  - To study the system, often assumptions/approximations, both logical and mathematical, are made and hence a model is formed
  - Model is solved by mathematical methods to get simulation (in terms of measures of performance)
